##Pitch: How are black inmates screened and treated for depression?
Slug: mentallyill-black-inmates

####Who cares? 
Those suffering from mental illness, families with someone who has mental illness, [black] activists/organizations, people concerned about the costs of prisons
####Why do we care now? 

In the past year, there has been national media attention on several instances of police violence against black mentally ill suspects and inmates. On March 9, 27-year-old Anthony Hill, an unarmed black male suffering from bipolar disorder, was fatally shot by a police officer in Georgia. An episode of This American Life, aired Feb. 13, [â€œCops See it Differently, Part Two,â€](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/548/transcript) detailed a black mentally ill manâ€™s struggle with being harassed by the police. 

Already in 2015, conditions within prisons have received national media attention (e.g. Rikers, [Attica](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/nyregion/attica-prison-infamous-for-bloodshed-faces-a-reckoning-as-guards-go-on-trial.html) â€¦). Rikers has been under fire for the mistreatment of several documented mentally ill inmates, including the [death](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/nyregion/gross-incompetence-cited-in-rikers-island-death.html) of one. We will look at data about the prevalence of mental illness among inmates (particularly black inmates) and the kinds of treatment options that are offered.

####Our key datasets so far:

**Dataset #1: From the Bureau of Justice Statistics (from 2006)**
[(Zip file containing the csvs and metadata)](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/sheets/mhppji.zip)
* mhppjit03.csv Table 3. Prison and jail inmates who had a mental health problem, by selected characteristics 
* mhppjitt05.csv Table 5. Mental health treatment received by all local jail inmates
* mhppjit04.csv Table 4. Homelessness, employment before arrest, and family background of prison and jail inmates, by mental health status
* mhppjit14.csv Table 14. Mental health treatment received by inmates who had a mental health problem
* mhppjit15.csv Table 15. Mental health treatment received by all State prison inmates, 2004 and 1997

**Dataset #2: From â€œMental Health of Prisoners,â€ a December 2014 â€œAmerican Journal of Public Healthâ€ article by two University of Texas researchers.**
From the methods section: â€œIn summary, 14,499 state and 3,686 federal prisoners were surveyed using both direct in-person interviewing (for demographic information) and computer-assisted personal interviewing because of the sensitive nature of many items on the questionnaire. The response rate was 89.8% for inmates in the state sample and 86.7% for those in the federal sample.â€

We will need to talk to people with more academic research/statistics knowledge to have them explain the data sets to us to make sure weâ€™re understanding them correctly.
