  			  <h1> Intro </h1>
  			  <p>Lede: In New York City, nearly 40 percent of jail inmates suffer from a mental illness. And at the city’s primary jail, Rikers Island, 67 percent have indicated a mental health issue and 21 percent are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/nyregion/new-york-city-to-expand-health-services-for-mentally-ill-inmates.html?_r=0">“severely mentally ill."</a></p>
			
			  <p>Nutgraf: This isn’t a problem for just a few people. Almost two-thirds of inmates surveyed in state prisons nationwide have at least one mental illness, according to <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=789">a 2004 survey</a> by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Prisons and jails don’t have a uniform way of screening for or treating mental illnesses. Those inconsistencies are especially problematic as inmates are transferred from one prison to another during their sentences. And when inmates leave the correctional system, they can often struggle to find treatment for their illnesses. 
</p>
<p>The New York City mayor’s task force, which launched in 2014, looks closely at the connections between the criminal justice system and behavioral health. The group put out an <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/criminaljustice/downloads/pdf/annual-report-complete.pdf">action plan</a> in December, and has a $130 million four-year investment.
And the state has a new law that allows for more access to treatment for recently released prisoners who received mental health treatments during their last three years, <a href="http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/new-york/2015/03/13/mental-health-ny-prisoners/70271840/">the AP reports.</a></p>

  			  <h1> How prevalent are mental illness within the prison population?</h1>
  			 	  <div class="col-md-6">
<p>Within New York City, the proportion of inmates with mental health needs is increasing. (see "A growing concern" graphic) According to <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/criminaljustice/downloads/pdf/annual-report-complete.pdf">a report</a> from the mayor’s office, the trend seen in the graphic has continued, with the overall population decreasing to 11,408 in 2014, but with 38 percent of inmates having at least one mental health issue. The report also says that “approximately 7 percent of the jail population is made up of individuals with serious mental illness, meaning that they suffer from diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.”</p>

<p>In New York state prisons, the level of inmates with serious mental illnesses increases, which follows a national pattern of local jails having smaller proportions of mentally ill than state or federal prisons. <a href="http://www.tacreports.org/storage/documents/treatment-behind-bars/treatment-behind-bars.pdf">The Treatment Advocacy Center</a> cites a 2008 article in the Poughkeepsie Journal as saying “about 12 percent of the state prison population is afflicted with a serious mental illness.”</p>

<p>Nationally, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found in 2004 that almost two-thirds of state prison inmates reported having at least one mental illness. <a href=”http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf”>A report</a> on the same survey found that 15 percent of state prisoners “reported symptoms that met the criteria for a psychotic disorder.”</p>

  <h1>How are cities and states trying to address the problem?</h1>
<p>In early April, a federal judge issued a permanent injunction against the state of Washington, requiring them to provide mentally ill inmates with competency evaluations and treatment within seven days of being detained. According to <a href=”http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/judge-washington-must-fix-problem-with-jailing-mentally-ill/”>The Seattle Times</a>, U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman “gave the state nine months to resolve the competency crisis by hiring needed staff and providing hospital bed space.” The injunction came after the American Civil Liberties Union and Disability Rights of Washington and lawyers of mentally ill inmates filed a class-action lawsuit against the state.</p>
