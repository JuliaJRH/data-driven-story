  			  <h1> Intro </h1>
  			  <p>Lede: In New York City, nearly 40 percent of jail inmates suffer from a mental illness. And at the city’s primary jail, Rikers Island, 67 percent have indicated a mental health issue and 21 percent are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/nyregion/new-york-city-to-expand-health-services-for-mentally-ill-inmates.html?_r=0">“severely mentally ill."</a></p>
			
			  <p>Nutgraf: This isn’t a problem for just a few people. Almost two-thirds of inmates surveyed in state prisons nationwide have at least one mental illness, according to <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=789">a 2004 survey</a> by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Prisons and jails don’t have a uniform way of screening for or treating mental illnesses. Those inconsistencies are especially problematic as inmates are transferred from one prison to another during their sentences. And when inmates leave the correctional system, they can often struggle to find treatment for their illnesses. 
</p>
<p>Launched in 2014, the New York city mayor’s task force, a four-year $130 million investment, aims to bring together behaviour health and the criminal justice system.
And the state has a new law that allows for more access to treatment for recently released prisoners who received mental health treatments during their last three years, <a href="http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/new-york/2015/03/13/mental-health-ny-prisoners/70271840/">the AP reports.</a></p>

  <h1>How are cities and states trying to address the problem?</h1>
<p>In early April, a federal judge issued a permanent injunction against the state of Washington, requiring them to provide mentally ill inmates with competency evaluations and treatment within seven days of being detained. According to <a href=”http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/judge-washington-must-fix-problem-with-jailing-mentally-ill/”>The Seattle Times</a>, U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman “gave the state nine months to resolve the competency crisis by hiring needed staff and providing hospital bed space.” The injunction came after the American Civil Liberties Union and Disability Rights of Washington and lawyers of mentally ill inmates filed a class-action lawsuit against the state.</p>
